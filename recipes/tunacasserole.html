        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Boil the noodles.</strong> Cook the noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions, just until al dente. For wide egg noodles, this should only take about 5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stir together milk and soup.</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together condensed cream of mushroom soup and milk until completely combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add remaining ingredients.</strong> Stir in the cooked noodles, tuna and peas. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add topping.</strong> Transfer the noodle mixture to a 1 Â½-quart baking dish. Add grated cheese and sprinkle crushed potato chips on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake.</strong> Bake the casserole uncovered in a 350 degree F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the inside is hot and bubbly.
        </li>
    </ol>
